The units of the Features were not mentioned in the dataset and as a proof I have opened the galaxy.Z00.h5 File using the hdf5 viewer and attached the screenshots of it in Dataset folder with names 1.jpg and 2.jpg. The units shouldn't pose any issue with the machine learning model as anyways the features are scaled between [0,1] for minmax scaling and [-1,1] for Standard Scaling so even if a particular feature is in Solar Mass unit or in normal kgs, it will be scaled to the same value between [-1,1] for standard and [0,1] for minmax scaler.
